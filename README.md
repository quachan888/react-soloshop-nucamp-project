## Nucamp Week 1 - Portfolio Project Assignment

**1. How your Project will Benefit from React**

What are the main differences between Bootstrap and React?

-   Bootstrap is a CSS library, with pre-build CSS classes so I can build my website well-styled faster.
-   React is a Javascript library for building user interface or UI components.

What will React allow you to do that would have been difficult with Bootstrap?

-   React help me to build components which I can reuse multiple times.
-   My project is an eCommerce website which has multiple cards presenting products (image, title, description, price, location...). By using React, I can just create only 1 component Card and then pass the data to that component.
